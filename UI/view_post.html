                <textarea rows="12" cols="40">I am in my 20s and i know all the witch spells offhead. Like Hermione Granger without all the hardwork because well....i did learn most spells from her story. Even then, I should have received my letter. Maybe not from Hogwarts. Durmstrang had awesome spirit. It struck macho fear. I forget the other school. It reminded me of panthers. Graceful but it would kill in one swoop. That is the best kind of aura. I think that is why i like both dragons and panthers.</textarea>
